This is a monorepo with most of Daily's frontend projects. It was created as part of Daily 2.0 refactor to separate concerns to different standalone projects. The main concept of the refactor was to enable others use Daily style guidelines in their applications as well.

## Technology

* Yarn for managing dependencies.
* Node v10.12.0 (a `.nvmrc` is presented for [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) users).
* [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for managing the monorepo.

## Projects

### components

Library which implements Daily's style guidelines.
It mainly contains Vue generic components (such as modals, text boxes and toggles) but also consists of style sheets which define color platte, typography and more.
For more information [click here](https://github.com/dailynowco/daily-apps/tree/master/packages/components).

### services

Typescript library with clients for interaction with Daily's backend services.
The library encapsulates the http requests to simple methods and defines relevant types to make it easy to use.

### extension

Daily browser extension in its glory, written in Vue and powered by the components and services libraries.
